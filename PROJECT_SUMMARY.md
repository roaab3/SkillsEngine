## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

### System Architecture
The Skills Engine follows an **Onion Architecture** pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Domain Layer**: Core entities (Skill, Competency, UserSkill) and domain services
- **Application Layer**: Business use cases (Profile Initialization, Verification Processing, Gap Analysis)
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database access, Kafka, OpenAI API, and external integrations
- **Presentation Layer**: REST Controllers and API Gateway

### Key Workflows
1. **Profile Initialization**: UserCreatedEvent ‚Üí AI skill extraction ‚Üí taxonomy mapping ‚Üí assessment generation
2. **Verification & Recalculation**: AssessmentResultAvailableEvent ‚Üí skill updates ‚Üí competency recalculation ‚Üí gap analysis
3. **Skill Discovery**: Course Builder request ‚Üí semantic search ‚Üí external framework query ‚Üí normalized results

### Database Schema
- **Core Tables**: user, user_competency, user_skill, competency, skill
- **Relationship Tables**: competency_skill, skill_subskill, competency_subcompetency
- **Multi-Tenant**: Company isolation via id_company with data segregation
- **Verification System**: Audit trail with verification sources and evaluation tracking

## üöÄ Deployment Status

### Environments
- **Development**: Local development with Docker containers
- **Staging**: Staging environment for testing and validation
- **Production**: Production environment with monitoring and alerts

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Trigger**: Push to main branch
- **Jobs**: Unit tests ‚Üí Integration tests ‚Üí Security scan ‚Üí Performance tests ‚Üí E2E tests ‚Üí Deploy
- **Quality Gates**: All tests must pass before deployment

### Deployment Platforms
- **Backend**: Railway with automatic scaling
- **Frontend**: Vercel with global CDN
- **Database**: Railway PostgreSQL with automated backups
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability stack

## üîí Security & Compliance
