# Step 2: Roadmap & Milestones - Summary

## Project Scope
**Comprehensive Skills Engine Project** - Full-scale implementation serving multiple organizations with complete feature set including skill/competency management, user profiling, gap analysis, assessment integration, multi-tenant support, analytics, dashboards, reporting, and ecosystem APIs.

## Key Participants
- **PO (Product Owner)**: Business value and feature prioritization
- **SA (Solution Architect)**: Architecture decisions and development sequence
- **DO (DevOps)**: Milestones and deployment planning

## MVP Features (7 Core Features)
1. **Skills and Competency Data Model** - Core taxonomy with company-specific support
2. **User Skill and Competency Profile** - Personal skill visibility and tracking
3. **Basic Skill Assessment Integration** - Assessment microservice connectivity
4. **Skill Gap Analysis** - Automated gap identification and reporting
5. **API Layer for Integrations** - RESTful APIs for ecosystem services
6. **Data Management and Versioning** - CRUD operations and version tracking
7. **User Interface for Viewing Skills** - Simple web-based dashboard

## Development Sequence (8-Week Phases)
### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-8)
- Core data model with multi-tenant support
- Admin tools for competency management
- User profiles and skill tracking
- Basic gap analysis

### Phase 2: Integration (Weeks 9-16)
- Assessment microservice integration
- Ecosystem APIs (Directory, Course Builder, Learning Analytics)
- Advanced analytics and dashboards

### Phase 3: Production (Weeks 17-24)
- Complete UI/UX implementation
- Reporting system
- Production deployment and optimization

## Key Milestones
- **Week 2**: Database Foundation Ready
- **Week 3**: Admin Tools Functional
- **Week 4**: User Profile System Live
- **Week 5**: Gap Analysis Engine Ready
- **Week 6**: Assessment Integration Complete
- **Week 7**: Ecosystem APIs Ready
- **Week 8**: MVP User Interface Deployed

## Company-Specific Requirements
- Multi-tenant data isolation and security
- Custom competency libraries per organization
- Admin management interfaces for HR/L&D teams
- Global skill linking for gap analysis functionality

## Risk Assessment
### High Impact Risks
- Multi-tenant data isolation complexity
- Integration complexity with multiple microservices
- Scope creep due to comprehensive feature set
- Team capacity constraints for 24-week timeline
- Data privacy compliance across organizations

### Mitigation Strategies
- Early database design validation
- API-first design with fallback mechanisms
- Strict phase-based delivery
- Resource planning and team scaling
- Security-first design and compliance review

## Step 2 Status: âœ… COMPLETE
Comprehensive roadmap established with clear phases, milestones, and risk mitigation strategies. Ready to proceed to Step 3.
