  <WorkflowSteps>
    <Step number="1" name="Initial Development Setup">
      <Round number="1">
        <SystemArchitect>We need a robust foundation with enforced branch policies, automated CI checks, and scalable repository structure. I propose a monorepo approach with clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and AI components.</SystemArchitect>
        <DevOpsEngineer>I agree with the monorepo approach. Let's implement GitHub Actions with reusable workflow templates for CI/CD, pre-commit hooks, security scanning, and automated testing. We should also include infrastructure-as-code with Terraform for cloud resources.</DevOpsEngineer>
        <FullStackDeveloper>The monorepo is good, but we need Docker-based local development environment for fast onboarding. Include hot-reload for both frontend and backend, with shared environment variables and database seeding scripts.</FullStackDeveloper>

        <AI_Engineer>For AI integration, we need data versioning with DVC, model experiment tracking with MLflow, and GPU resource management. Include data privacy compliance tools from the start.</AI_Engineer>

        <DevOpsEngineer>Perfect structure. I'll add GitHub Actions for: linting, testing, security scanning, dependency updates, and deployment. Include environment-specific configurations and secret management with GitHub Secrets.</DevOpsEngineer>
