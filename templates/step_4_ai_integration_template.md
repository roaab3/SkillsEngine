**Question 7:** How will you collect and prepare data for AI training? What data preprocessing or cleaning is needed?

*[Follow-up: Ask about data sources, quality issues, and transformation requirements]*

**Question 8:** How often do you expect to retrain or update your AI models? What triggers model updates?

*[Follow-up: Ask about data drift, performance degradation, and update frequency]*

**Question 9:** What's your strategy for handling new or unseen data? How should the system behave when AI confidence is low?

*[Follow-up: Ask about fallback mechanisms, human-in-the-loop processes, and uncertainty handling]*

### Integration Points
**Question 10:** Where in your application workflow should AI be integrated? Think about user touchpoints and system processes.

*[Follow-up: Ask about specific user actions that should trigger AI, and how results should be presented]*

**Question 11:** How should AI interact with your existing business logic? Should AI decisions override human input or work alongside it?

*[Follow-up: Ask about decision authority, override mechanisms, and human oversight requirements]*

**Question 12:** What APIs or services will you need to integrate with AI capabilities? Consider external AI services, data sources, or output destinations.

*[Follow-up: Ask about API requirements, data formats, and integration complexity]*

### Data Governance & Privacy
**Question 13:** What privacy and security requirements do you have for AI data? Consider data anonymization, encryption, and access controls.

*[Follow-up: Ask about compliance requirements, data retention, and user consent]*

**Question 14:** How will you handle bias and fairness in your AI models? What measures will you take to ensure equitable outcomes?

*[Follow-up: Ask about bias detection, fairness metrics, and mitigation strategies]*

**Question 15:** What's your strategy for AI model versioning and rollback? How will you manage model updates and potential issues?

*[Follow-up: Ask about A/B testing, gradual rollouts, and emergency rollback procedures]*

### Evaluation & Monitoring
**Question 16:** How will you measure AI model performance in production? What metrics and monitoring do you need?

*[Follow-up: Ask about specific KPIs, alerting thresholds, and performance dashboards]*

**Question 17:** How will you collect user feedback on AI recommendations? What mechanisms will help improve model performance?

*[Follow-up: Ask about feedback loops, user rating systems, and continuous improvement processes]*

**Question 18:** What's your plan for handling AI model failures or degraded performance? How will you ensure system reliability?

*[Follow-up: Ask about fallback strategies, error handling, and recovery procedures]*
