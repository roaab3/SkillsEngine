# Step 8: Code Review & QA - Summary

## Key Participants
- **QA (Quality Assurance)**: Testing strategies and quality gates
- **FSD (Full-Stack Developer)**: Code review criteria and implementation standards

## Test Matrix
### Unit Testing
- **Scope**: Individual components and business logic functions
- **Coverage Target**: ≥ 85% of lines and functions
- **Frameworks**: Jest (Node.js), Vitest (Frontend)
- **Focus Areas**: Core modules, data validation, utility functions, domain services
- **Quality Gate**: All unit tests must pass with coverage threshold before PR merge

### Integration Testing
- **Scope**: API endpoints, database operations, microservice communication
- **Frameworks**: Supertest, Postman/Newman
- **Focus Areas**: REST APIs, database layer, Kafka events, external integrations
- **Quality Gate**: All integration tests must pass before staging deployment

### End-to-End Testing
- **Scope**: Complete user workflows across UI and backend
- **Frameworks**: Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium
- **Focus Areas**: End Learner workflows, Admin workflows, System workflows
- **Cross-Browser**: Chrome, Edge, Firefox
- **Responsive Testing**: Desktop, tablet, mobile viewports
- **Quality Gate**: E2E regression suite must pass before production deployment

### Performance Testing
- **Scope**: Load, stress, and response time validation
- **Frameworks**: k6, Locust, or JMeter
- **Metrics**: ≤300ms response time, <1s gap analysis, 200+ RPS, 50-80ms pgvector queries
- **Stress Testing**: 2–3× expected peak load
- **Quality Gate**: All endpoints must meet SLA performance benchmarks

### Security Testing
- **Scope**: Authentication, authorization, data protection, compliance
- **Frameworks**: OWASP ZAP, custom security tests
- **Focus Areas**: API security, data encryption, multi-tenant isolation, GDPR compliance
- **Quality Gate**: No critical security vulnerabilities before production deployment

## CI Jobs
### 1. Unit Tests & Coverage
- **Trigger**: Pull Request
- **Steps**: Install dependencies → Run tests → Generate coverage → Check threshold → Upload to codecov
- **Quality Gate**: All tests pass + coverage threshold met

### 2. Integration Tests
- **Trigger**: Push to develop branch
- **Steps**: Setup test database → Run integration tests → Test APIs → Validate database → Test Kafka
- **Quality Gate**: All integration tests pass

### 3. Security Scan
- **Trigger**: Pull Request
- **Steps**: Dependency scan → OWASP ZAP → Code analysis → Secrets detection
- **Quality Gate**: No critical vulnerabilities found

### 4. Performance Tests
- **Trigger**: Push to main branch
- **Steps**: Load testing → Response time validation → Database performance → Memory profiling
- **Quality Gate**: Performance benchmarks met

### 5. E2E Tests
- **Trigger**: Push to main branch
- **Steps**: Deploy to staging → Run E2E suite → Cross-browser testing → Responsive testing
- **Quality Gate**: All E2E tests pass

### 6. Deploy to Production
- **Trigger**: Push to main branch (after all tests pass)
- **Steps**: Deploy to Railway/Vercel → Run migrations → Health checks → Smoke tests
- **Quality Gate**: Successful deployment + health checks pass

## Quality Thresholds
### Code Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: ≥ 85% line and function coverage
- **Integration Tests**: ≥ 70% API endpoint coverage
- **E2E Tests**: ≥ 90% critical user journey coverage

### Performance Benchmarks
- **API Response Time**: ≤ 300ms for 95th percentile
- **Gap Analysis Time**: < 1 second
- **Database Query Time**: ≤ 100ms for complex queries
- **Throughput**: ≥ 200 RPS sustained load

### Security Standards
- **Vulnerability Severity**: No critical or high severity vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scan**: All dependencies up to date
- **Secrets Detection**: No secrets in codebase
- **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 for all communications

### Accessibility Standards
- **WCAG Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All functionality accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Reader**: Compatible with screen readers
- **Color Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
