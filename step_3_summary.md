# Step 3: Functional & Non-Functional Requirements - Summary

## Key Participants
- **PO (Product Owner)**: User stories and business requirements
- **FSD (Full-Stack Developer)**: Technical requirements and system behavior
- **AI (AI Specialist)**: AI capabilities and integration
- **QA (Quality Assurance)**: Testing requirements and quality criteria

## User Stories
### End Learner (Employee/Student)
- **View Skills & Competencies**: Understand proficiency levels in each area
- **Identify Skill Gaps**: See missing skills for target competencies
- **Track Progress Over Time**: Monitor advancement toward career goals
- **Access Learning Recommendations**: Receive personalized learning paths

### System Integration / API Consumers
- **Sync User Data**: Receive user profile and role information from Directory Service
- **Update Skill Verification**: Process assessment results and update competency levels
- **Provide Skills Data**: Expose APIs for Course Builder, Learning Analytics, Learner AI

## Business Logic Requirements
### Skills & Competency Management
- Four-layer skill taxonomy (L1 → L4) with hierarchical relationships
- Many-to-many competency-skill mapping
- Company-specific competencies for multi-tenant organizations
- CRUD operations with versioning and history

### User Skill & Competency Profiles
- Binary proficiency tracking for L3/L4, calculated for competencies
- Progress percentages and audit logs
- External source initialization (Directory Service)

### Gap Analysis & Reporting
- Missing skills identification
- Value Proposition Completion Percentage calculation
- Gap reports for learners and managers
- Asynchronous missing skills notifications to Learner AI

### Assessment Integration
- Assessment score processing from Assessment Service
- Configurable verification thresholds for L3/L4 skills
- Automatic competency level recalculation

### Multi-Service API Integration
- APIs for Directory, Course Builder, Learning Analytics, Content Studio
- Asynchronous event handling for updates and gap reporting

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Performance (NFR 6.1)
- Gap analysis completion: <1 second
- Throughput: 200+ RPS minimum

### Scalability (NFR 6.2)
- Active users: 100,000+
- Nano-skills: 50,000+

### Security & Audit (NFR 6.3)
- Complete audit trail for profile verification updates
- Secure authentication for external API calls
- Securely managed access tokens/API keys

### Data Trust Priority (NFR 6.4)
- Assessment Scores (Highest) → Certifications → User Claims/AI Extractions (Lowest)

### Configurability (NFR 6.5)
- API for reading/updating verification thresholds
- System-wide and skill-specific configuration support

## AI Capabilities
### AI-Powered Data Extraction & Normalization
- **Purpose**: Extract skills from unstructured sources and normalize to taxonomy
- **Input Sources**: Resumes, LinkedIn profiles, job postings, documents, course metadata
- **Processing**: NLP for skill detection, terminology standardization, hierarchy mapping
- **Benefits**: Reduced manual entry, consistent naming, faster profile creation
- **Integration**: User profiles, assessment processing, learning content analysis
