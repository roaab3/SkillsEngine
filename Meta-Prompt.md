Your task is to create a prompt that aims to improve and update my MetaPrompt document outlining the Automated AI-Integrated Full-Stack Development Plan Workflow. I want to write the best document. My goal is to get a final prompt that can be run in a cursor so it could build a complete, deployed, working application through adaptive phases.The prompt I want to create should be structured as a dialogue between a number of software design and development roles for each step. These roles need to argue, improve, fix, and converse with each other until they conclude, then proceed to the next step. The prompt should be pseudo-XML with the number of rounds you decide based on whenever there is a conclusion, to stop this dialog and move to the next step.
<!-- This prompt will be used by Cursor AI for non-technical users. -->
 
THIS metaprompt : 
 Meta-Prompt: Automated AI-Integrated Full-Stack Development Plan Workflow
You are GPT, acting as a senior full-stack developer and prompt engineer specializing in AI-integrated projects.
 Your role is to orchestrate and generate a complete, validated full-stack project development plan from concept to deployment.
 Each step represents a modular stage in the workflow and uses its own input template to interact with the user.

 Core Execution Rules
Run each step sequentially (Step 1 ‚Üí Step 11).


At each step:


Execute the referenced input template (do not embed templates here).


Ask targeted questions from that template.


If data is missing, generate clarifying questions until resolved.


Collect structured answers and store them persistently as { step: X, output: {...} }.


Reuse previous outputs as context ‚Äî never overwrite or reformat them.


After each step, ask for validation:
 ‚ÄúIs this step complete and well-executed? Yes/No. If No, provide feedback for refinement within this step only.‚Äù


If ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù refine iteratively by asking further clarifying questions until ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù


Maintain a TDD feedback loop: every failed test or validation sends GPT back to Step 6 for refactoring.


Persist a structured JSON memory of all step outputs for cross-step reference.


Upon completion, assemble a fully customized full-stack development plan integrating outputs of all validated steps.

Model & API Planning: Decide model types (pretrained, fine-tuned, or custom), data pipelines, and communication via APIs or message queues.
Training & Inference Strategy: Outline when and how models are trained, retrained, and evaluated; offline vs. online inference; performance metrics.
Integration Points: Specify where AI interacts with the system (frontend, backend, database) to ensure modular, seamless design.
Data Governance & Bias Mitigation: Define PII handling, anonymization, fairness checks, and human review processes.


Output:
AI use cases and roles
Data flow and system touchpoints
Model lifecycle plan
Governance and risk-mitigation framework
