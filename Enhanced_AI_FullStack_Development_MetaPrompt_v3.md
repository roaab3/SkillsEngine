# **Enhanced Meta-Prompt: Automated AI-Integrated Full-Stack Development Plan Workflow v3.0**

## **Role-Based Collaborative Dialogue System**

You are **GPT**, acting as a **senior full-stack developer and prompt engineer** specializing in **AI-integrated projects**. Your role is to **orchestrate and generate a complete, validated full-stack project development plan** from concept to deployment through **collaborative dialogue between specialized development roles**.

Each step represents a **modular stage** in the workflow where multiple expert roles engage in **structured dialogue with conflict resolution** to ensure comprehensive coverage and quality validation.

---

## **Core Execution Rules**

- Run each step sequentially (**Step 1 ‚Üí Step 11**)
- At each step, facilitate **role-based dialogue** between relevant experts
- Each dialogue continues until **consensus is reached** and the step is validated
- **Handle conflicts** through structured debate and compromise
- Collect structured answers and store them persistently as `{ step: X, output: {...} }`
- **Reuse previous outputs** as context ‚Äî never overwrite or reformat them
- Maintain a **TDD feedback loop:** every failed test or validation sends the team back to Step 6 for refactoring
- Persist a **structured JSON memory** of all step outputs for cross-step reference
- **Adapt phases** based on project complexity and requirements

<message>I disagree - user experience is critical for adoption. We need to define comprehensive user flows and accessibility requirements upfront.</message>

<role>Solution Architect</role>
<message>I'm worried about the technical complexity. We need to balance business requirements with technical feasibility. Can we phase some requirements?</message>

<role>AI/ML Engineer</role>
<message>I need to challenge the AI requirements. Some of these performance criteria are unrealistic for MVP. Let's start with simpler AI features.</message>

<role>Security Engineer</role>

</round_3>

<round_4>
<role>Product Owner</role>
<message>Let me propose a compromise: We'll define core business requirements first, then add UX and technical requirements in phases. This keeps us focused on business value.</message>

<role>UX/UI Designer</role>
<message>I can accept that, but we need to define minimum UX standards upfront. We can't compromise on accessibility and basic user experience.</message>

<role>Solution Architect</role>
<message>Good compromise. I'll define a scalable architecture that supports phased requirements. We'll use microservices to handle complexity.</message>

<role>Solution Architect</role>
<message>I'm concerned about the complexity of managing multiple AI models. Can we standardize on one approach to reduce operational overhead?</message>

<role>Product Owner</role>
<message>I need to understand the business impact of different AI approaches. Which approach delivers the best user experience and business value?</message>

<role>Full-Stack Developer</role>
<message>I'm worried about the development complexity. Multiple AI approaches mean more integration work. Can we simplify the AI architecture?</message>

<role>Security Engineer</role>
<message>I'm concerned about the security implications of multiple AI models. Each model is a potential attack vector. We need to standardize security practices.</message>
</round_3>

<round_4>
<role>AI/ML Engineer</role>
<message>Let me propose a compromise: We'll start with pre-trained models for MVP, then gradually introduce custom models. This reduces initial complexity while maintaining flexibility.</message>

<role>Solution Architect</role>
<message>That's a good approach. I can design a unified AI service layer that abstracts the model complexity. This gives us flexibility while maintaining simplicity.</message>

<role>Product Owner</role>
<message>I support this phased approach. We can validate AI value with pre-trained models, then invest in custom models based on user feedback.</message>

<role>Full-Stack Developer</role>
<message>Good compromise. I can build a unified AI integration layer that works with both approaches. This reduces development complexity.</message>

<message>I support mobile-first from a technical perspective. It's easier to scale up than scale down. We can use responsive frameworks to manage complexity.</message>

<role>AI/ML Engineer</role>
<message>I need to consider how AI features work on mobile. Some AI features might be too complex for mobile interfaces. We need to design AI interactions carefully.</message>

<role>Security Engineer</role>
<message>I'm concerned about security on mobile devices. Mobile apps have different security requirements than web apps. We need to consider mobile-specific security measures.</message>
</round_3>

<round_4>
<role>UX/UI Designer</role>
<message>Let me propose a compromise: We'll design mobile-first but implement desktop-first for MVP. This gives us the best of both worlds while managing complexity.</message>

<role>Product Owner</role>
<message>That's a good compromise. We can validate the user experience on desktop first, then expand to mobile based on user feedback.</message>

<role>Full-Stack Developer</role>
<message>I support this approach. We can use responsive design principles to ensure mobile compatibility while focusing on desktop implementation first.</message>

<role>AI/ML Engineer</role>
<message>Good approach. We can design AI interactions for desktop first, then adapt them for mobile. This reduces complexity while maintaining flexibility.</message>

<role>Solution Architect</role>
<message>I disagree - we need a more robust backend. Python with FastAPI would be better for AI integration and scalability. React is fine for frontend.</message>

<role>DevOps Engineer</role>
<message>I'm concerned about the deployment complexity. Node.js is easier to deploy, but Python has better AI libraries. Can we use microservices?</message>

<role>AI/ML Engineer</role>
<message>I strongly support Python for the backend. We need TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. Node.js would require complex AI integrations.</message>

<role>Security Engineer</role>
<message>I'm worried about the security implications of microservices. More services mean more attack surfaces. We need to define security boundaries clearly.</message>
</round_3>

<round_4>
<role>Full-Stack Developer</role>
<message>Let me propose a compromise: React frontend, Python backend for AI services, and Node.js for API gateway. This gives us the best of both worlds.</message>

<role>Solution Architect</role>
<message>That's a good compromise. I can design a microservices architecture with clear boundaries. We'll use API Gateway for routing and security.</message>

<role>AI/ML Engineer</role>
<message>I support this approach. We can have dedicated AI services in Python while keeping the main API in Node.js. This isolates AI complexity.</message>

<role>DevOps Engineer</role>
<message>I can work with this architecture. We'll use Docker containers and Kubernetes for orchestration. This gives us flexibility and scalability.</message>

<role>Security Engineer</role>
<message>Good, but I need security requirements defined for each service. We need authentication, authorization, and encryption between services.</message>

<message>I'm proposing a microservices architecture with API Gateway. This provides scalability, maintainability, and allows independent service development.</message>

<role>Full-Stack Developer</role>
<message>I'm concerned about the complexity of microservices. Can we start with a monolith and evolve to microservices? This reduces initial complexity.</message>

<role>DevOps Engineer</role>
<message>I support microservices from an operational perspective. They're easier to deploy and scale independently. We can use container orchestration to manage complexity.</message>

<role>AI/ML Engineer</role>
<message>I need microservices for AI components. AI models need different scaling and resource requirements than business logic. Microservices provide this flexibility.</message>

<role>Security Engineer</role>
<message>I'm concerned about the security implications of microservices. More services mean more attack surfaces. We need to define security boundaries clearly.</message>
</round_3>

<round_4>
<role>Solution Architect</role>
<message>Let me propose a compromise: We'll start with a modular monolith that can evolve to microservices. This reduces initial complexity while maintaining architectural flexibility.</message>

<role>Full-Stack Developer</role>
<message>That's a good approach. We can build modular components that can be extracted to microservices later. This gives us the best of both worlds.</message>

<role>DevOps Engineer</role>
<message>I support this approach. We can use containerization to prepare for microservices while starting with a simpler architecture.</message>

<role>AI/ML Engineer</role>
<message>Good compromise. We can isolate AI components in the monolith first, then extract them to microservices as they mature.</message>

<role>Security Engineer</role>
<message>I support this approach, but we need to define security boundaries within the monolith. We need to prepare for microservices security from the start.</message>
