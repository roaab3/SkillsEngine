# Step 10: Monitoring, Maintenance & Optimization - Summary

## Key Participants
- **DO (DevOps)**: Observability stack and monitoring infrastructure
- **QA (Quality Assurance)**: Error tracking and performance monitoring
- **PO (Product Owner)**: Business metrics and user feedback collection

## Observability Stack
### Telemetry Collection
- **Instrumentation**: OpenTelemetry for traces, spans, and basic metrics from Node.js services
- **Metrics**: Prometheus scrape + long-term storage (Thanos or Cortex) for scale
- **Dashboarding**: Grafana for metrics dashboards and alerts
- **Tracing/APM**: Jaeger (OpenTelemetry-compatible) or commercial APM (DataDog, New Relic)
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logs shipped to ELK/EFK (Elasticsearch/Fluentd/Kibana)
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry for uncaught exceptions, stack traces, and release correlation
- **Event Bus**: Kafka metrics via Prometheus Kafka Exporter and consumer lag monitoring

### Synthetic Monitoring
- **Uptime Checks**: Pingdom, UptimeRobot, or Grafana synthetic monitoring
- **Key Endpoints**: Health checks, profile page render, critical API endpoints

### Storage & Retention
- **Metrics**: High resolution (1-2s) short-term (7-14 days), downsampled long-term (90+ days)
- **Traces**: 100% for high-priority endpoints, 1-5% for background jobs; retain 7-30 days
- **Logs**: Hot (30 days), cold (90-365 days) depending on compliance needs

## Error Budget Policy
### SLOs (Service Level Objectives)
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime (monthly) for core API endpoints
- **Latency**: 95th percentile API latency < 300ms; 99th percentile < 1s for read endpoints
- **Gap Analysis**: End-to-end (event to updated competency stored) ≤ 1s for typical loads
- **Error Rate**: < 0.5% 5xx errors across production traffic

### Error Budget Management
- **Monthly Downtime**: ≈ 43.2 minutes for 99.9% availability
- **Consumption Tracking**: Monthly error budget consumption monitoring
- **Freeze Threshold**: >50% consumed triggers review and freeze on non-essential releases

### Performance Budget
- **DB Query Time**: p95 query time for taxonomy resolution < 100ms
- **Kafka Consumer Lag**: < 500ms for standard load; alert if > 5s

## Alerts & Dashboards
### Alert Priorities
#### P0/Critical
- Service down or health-check failing (all instances)
- Kafka consumer group lag > 10s / > 1000 messages on assessment topic
- DB connection pool exhausted or > 90% utilization
- Error rate spikes: 5xx rate > 5% sustained for 1 minute

#### P1/High
- p95 latency > SLA (> 300ms) for 5+ minutes
- Key business pipeline failures: no ProfileUpdatedEvent published
- Sentry: repeated uncaught exceptions with increasing volume

#### P2/Medium
- Elevated error rate (1-5%) for non-critical endpoints
- Partial resource saturation (CPU > 80% on many pods)

#### P3/Low
- Non-blocking log spikes, minor metric deviations, or infra warnings

### Dashboards
- **Service Overview**: Availability, RPS, latency p50/p95/p99, errors, instance count
- **Pipeline Health**: Consumer lag, event rates in/out (Assessment → Skills Engine → Learner AI)
- **DB & Cache**: Slow queries, connections, index usage, Redis hit rate
- **Domain Metrics**: Competencies recalculated, skills verified, number of gaps generated
- **SLO/Error Budget**: Remaining error budget, burn rate
- **Release Health**: Deploy counts, rollback events, new errors by release tag

## Key Metrics & Events
### Service-Level Metrics
- Request rate (RPS) per endpoint
- Latency: p50, p95, p99 for REST/gRPC endpoints (ms)
- Error rate: 4xx / 5xx ratios and business errors
- Availability / uptime
- Consumer lag for Kafka topics

### Business Metrics
- Number of Competency recalculations per minute/hour
- Gap analyses completed per minute
- Number of user profile renders per minute
- Number of skills verified per hour (assessment-driven)
- Taxonomy import / discovery counts and failures

### Infrastructure Metrics
- DB CPU, connections, slow queries, locks, replication lag
- Redis memory usage, hit/miss rate
- Kafka broker health: ISR, partition under-replicated, throughput
- Pod/container CPU, memory, restarts, OOM events

### Tracing
- End-to-end trace for profile initialization (UserCreatedEvent → LLM → DB writes → CreatePrimaryAssignment)
- Trace for verification pipeline (Assessment event → skill updates → competency recompute → events)

## Feedback Loops
### Incident Lifecycle
Alert → Triage (on-call) → Mitigate (hotfix/scale/rollback) → Post-incident RCA → Fix in backlog

### Postmortems
Mandatory for P0/P1 incidents with action items and timelines

### User Feedback
- In-app "Report an issue" for users on profile page
- Collect contextual telemetry (request id, user id, trace id) with user reports
- Regular surveys and analytics to capture UX issues

### Runbooks
- **High Latency**: Check traces → isolate slow service → check DB slow queries → check cache
- **Kafka Lag**: Check consumer group health → confirm consumers running → scale consumers → check broker health
- **DB Connection Exhaustion**: Check pool settings → increase pool or scale workers → investigate long-running queries
- **Missing Events**: Confirm producer side published → check broker → check consumer offsets

## Optimization Backlog
### Database Optimization
- Index tuning for recursive CTEs during taxonomy traversal
- Optimize pgvector IVFFlat parameters and embedding refresh strategy

### Caching Strategy
- Add Redis caching for hot taxonomy lookups
- Plan TTL and invalidation strategy

### Cost Optimization
- Reduce trace/metric costs by improving sampling and aggregation
- Move to hosted APM if needed for better root-cause analysis
- Rightsizing instances, storage lifecycle policies for logs and traces

### Scaling Automation
- Horizontal scaling automation for Kafka consumers and gRPC services

## Ethics & Privacy Review
### GDPR Compliance
- Limit log retention of PII, store only pseudonymized identifiers in logs
- Implement data deletion APIs and procedures
- Access control for dashboards & logs to satisfy GDPR and security policies

### Audit Trails
- Persist audit_log (immutable) and ensure monitoring/backup policies
- Define retention windows per data type and automate lifecycle

## Best Practices
- **Correlation IDs**: Propagate request_id/trace_id through async events (Kafka message headers)
- **Structured Logs**: Include minimal PII, user_id as hashed or pseudonymized for GDPR compliance
- **Sampling**: Keep 100% errors and traces for failures, sample successful traces at lower rate
- **Alert Fatigue Reduction**: Use rate-based alerts, require sustained violations (>5 minutes) for non-critical alerts
- **Access Control**: Access control for dashboards & logs to satisfy GDPR and security policies

## Implementation Checklist
1. Instrument services with OpenTelemetry (metrics + traces) and export to Prometheus + Jaeger
2. Centralize logs to ELK/EFK and integrate Sentry for exceptions
3. Build Grafana dashboards: Service overview, Pipeline health, DB, SLOs
4. Define SLOs & thresholds and configure alerting rules in Grafana/Alertmanager
5. Create runbooks for top 5 incidents and onboard on-call rota
6. Add synthetic checks for profile render and profile update flows
7. Start small, measure, iterate — keep an optimization backlog

## Step 10 Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Comprehensive monitoring, maintenance, and optimization strategy established with observability stack, error budget policy, alerts/dashboards, feedback loops, and continuous improvement processes. Ready to proceed to Step 11.
