Input data is provided in the following format:

Your task:

- Determine which skills logically belong to each competency.

- If a competency has no matching skills, return an empty list for it.

Output format (JSON only):

{
  "mapping": {
    "<competency>": ["skill1", "skill2"],
    "<competency>": [],
    ...
  }
}
