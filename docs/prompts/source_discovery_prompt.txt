You are an AI assistant tasked with curating a comprehensive dataset of **official and authoritative sources** that provide **technological skills and/or professional competencies** in a structured manner.

---

🎯 GOAL

1. Identify **between 40 and 50 official sources** that describe **skills, or both skills and competencies**, with detailed hierarchical information suitable for database import.

2. For each source, **traverse all internal references, subpages, modules, or sections** that contain hierarchical skills or competencies with linked skills, and create a **separate JSON entry for each reference**.

3. **Skip any page or source that provides only general competencies without sub-competencies or associated skills**, and skip tutorials, conceptual explanations, overview pages, or guides.

Domains and roles to cover (examples, not limited to):

- Frontend Developer: JavaScript, CSS, HTML

- Backend Developer: Python, Java, Node.js, C#

- Full Stack Development

- Data Analyst / Data Scientist: SQL, Python Data, ML, Spark

- DevOps / Cloud: AWS, Azure, Kubernetes

- AI/ML

- Cybersecurity

- Networking

- Software Architecture

- UX/UI

- Other relevant technological roles or domains that provide hierarchical skills or competencies

💾 OUTPUT FORMAT

Return a **valid JSON array** with entries structured as follows:

[
  {
    "source_id": "string",                  // Unique ID (e.g., orgname-topic-subpage)
    "source_name": "string",                // Organization / website name
    "reference_index_url": "string",        // URL of this specific page or section
    "reference_type": "Documentation Index | Learning Path | Skills Catalog | Module",
    "access_method": "API | Scraping only",
    "hierarchy_support": "Yes | Partial | No",
    "provides": "skill | both",             // Only include skill or both
    "topics_covered": "string",             // Short description of topics / roles
    "skill_focus": "string",                // Specific skills or technology focus
    "notes": "string"                        // Extra info, e.g., parent-child relation
  }
]

⚙️ RULES

1. Only include **official or authoritative sources**, such as:  
   MDN, Microsoft Learn, AWS Docs, Google Developers, IBM Skills, Oracle, Cisco, Linux Foundation, ISO, e-CF, SFIA, Red Hat, VMware, SAP, Adobe, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Coursera, OpenAI, Databricks, etc.

2. Only include pages that provide **hierarchical skills or skills + competencies with linked skills**.

3. **Preferred URLs to include:** `/reference`, `/api/`, `/docs/`, `/learn/`, `/skills/`, `/framework/`, `/ref/spec`

4. **URLs to skip:** `/guide/`, `/tutorial/`, `/overview/`, `/concepts/`

5. For internal references or subpages, create **separate JSON entries** with unique `source_id` and maintain parent-child hierarchy in `notes`.

6. Ensure **coverage across all main roles/domains listed above**, and include other relevant technological domains if hierarchical skills or competencies are provided.

7. Return **only JSON**, no text, no markdown, no tables.

8. Output **between 40 and 50 high-quality entries**, covering both main sources and their internal references.
