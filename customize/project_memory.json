    "project_idea": "EduCora AI is a learning and development platform with 11 microservices. Skills Engine is the microservice that acts as the central authority for managing all skill and competency data within the platform. It maintains a hierarchical skill taxonomy, tracks user skill profiles, verifies skills, and enables precise gap analysis. Its core purpose is to provide accurate, structured skill data to other services, supporting personalized learning, career development, and talent management.",
    "business_goals": "The Skills Engine microservice establishes a single source of truth for skills and competencies across the EduCora AI platform, ensuring consistent, verified data for all training, assessments, and reporting. It enables accurate tracking of individual and team skill levels, allowing employees and trainers to identify gaps and take targeted development actions. By providing structured skill data to other services like Learner AI, Content Studio, and Course Builder, it supports competency-aligned content, courses, and learning paths, enhancing personalized learning experiences. For organizations, it delivers insights into workforce competencies, improves talent management, and ensures scalable, efficient, and data-driven decision-making for employee growth and upskilling initiatives.",

    "problem_statement": "Before Skills Engine, skill and competency data across the platform was fragmented, unstructured, and often unreliable. There was no single source of truth for skills, making it difficult to track user proficiency, identify skill gaps, and provide personalized learning paths. Skills Engine solves this by centralizing all skill data, verifying user skills, maintaining a flexible hierarchical taxonomy, and enabling precise gap analysis for career development.",

It ensures that all services within EduCora AI can rely on a consistent, authoritative source of skill information, enabling personalized growth, informed talent management, and measurable learning outcomes."
